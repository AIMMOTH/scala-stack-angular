## Run and Deploy

This project is dependent on a second project [servlet-scalajs-compiler](https://github.com/AIMMOTH/scala-js-compiler/tree/jetty-scalajs-compiler). Either clone and install it with maven or use copy of JAR included in src/main/resources.

Use maven and run $ mvn gcloud:run or $ mvn gcloud:deploy. Make sure to have GCloud installed and Python on path!

Another way is to compile (use IDE like eclipse) and copy dependencies into webapp, and use the python to run "dev_appserver.py" included in GCloud SDK.
